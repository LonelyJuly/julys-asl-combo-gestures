# How To Add Combo Gestures (in case you don't read the guide included):
1. Drag and drop the Gestures animator controller into the Gestures slot in your avatar descriptor.
2. Add "CopyGesture" and "SignToggle" bool parameters to your avatar's parameters.
3. Add "Copy Gesture" and "Sign Toggle" menu options as a Toggle in your avatar's Expressions Menu
4. Profit


*Note: Not every avatar's hands will look nice with this package, so you will need to adjust the animations accordingly to your avatar.*
